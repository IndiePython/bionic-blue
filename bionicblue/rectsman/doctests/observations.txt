Negative rects and ZeroDivisionError:
=====================================

Traceback from when I tried to unite g1.rect with the first
fixture rect when both the fixture rect and the underlying
rects of the RectsManager instance had negative dimensions.
In the occasion, g1.rect was managing the rects originally
added to the group 3 (g3).

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "launch.py", line 261, in <module>
    else: g1.rect.union_ip(fixture_rect)
  File "/home/kennedy/projects/danittr/repo_fixtures/rectsman/refac/rectsman/main.py", line 392, in union_ip
    self.size    = union.size
  File "/home/kennedy/projects/danittr/repo_fixtures/rectsman/refac/rectsman/spatial.py", line 299, in size
    self.inflate_ip(size_difference)
  File "/home/kennedy/projects/danittr/repo_fixtures/rectsman/refac/rectsman/main.py", line 255, in inflate_ip
    w_ratio = infl_w / union.w 
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

That is, somehow the RectsManager instance had a width of 0.
when we tried to unite it with the fixture rect.

I also got this error by reducing the size of the
RectsManager (by decrementing 40 many times) after
moving the negative rects away from each other until
there's no intersection between them.

Such behaviour should be further researched when the time is convenient (meaning for now there are too many tasks of higher priority on our todo list).
